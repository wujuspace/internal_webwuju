# JavaScript Modules

This folder contains separated JavaScript files for easier maintenance. Each file handles a specific section or functionality.

## File Structure

- **splash-screen.js** - Handles splash screen animation and service name cycling
- **navigation.js** - Manages sticky navigation scroll behavior
- **hero.js** - Controls gradient blob animation in hero section
- **project-showcase.js** - Handles project item hover effects and image display

## Usage

All scripts are automatically loaded in `index.html` and will run when the DOM is ready. Each script includes error checking to ensure it only runs when the required elements exist.
